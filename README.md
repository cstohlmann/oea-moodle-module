# Moodle Module

[Moodle](https://moodle.org/) is a learning management system (LMS) for educational institutions, that provides data on learners' digital activity in Moodle applications such as assignments, lesson progresses, forum discussions, and quiz results.

Using this module, data from Moodle can be exported into your organization's OEA data lakes to combine it with other datasets for a variety of use cases, including Learning Analytics. 
### CHANGE EVERYTHING BELOW
Moodle requires the implementation of [Microsoft School Data Sync](https://sds.microsoft.com/) on O365, which provides school and class roster data, to enable its reports in Teams. For production data, you will need an O365 education tenant as Microsoft Education Insights is only enabled for education tenants.

## Problem Statement and Module Impact

As education systems shift to digital applications and platforms to support learning, it is important for them to be able to see patterns of student digital activity across those applications and platforms. Most students use many different applications and platforms. This module provides data from education-specific applications in O365. This data can be combined with other digital activity data from other applications and platforms used in learning to develop "digital learning insights" across the ecosystem of applications and platforms a student uses.

Microsoft Insights data can be used for a variety of analytics purposes, including:
 - School and district dashboards for education leaders to identify variability in student activity in learning applications and platforms. 
 - Combining Insights data with other data sources to show the relationship between digital activity and other metrics such as attendance and assessments. 
 - Combining Insights data with student demographics, school information, or geographic data to show patterns of digital activity in relation to the whole education system. This can reveal patterns of inequality in access to digital tools and applications for learning.

</p>

<ins><strong>Preparation:</ins></strong> This module currently leans on v0.7 of the OEA framework. Ensure you have proper [Azure subscription and credentials](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/framework) and setup of the [OEA framework](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/framework#setup-of-framework-assets). This will include v0.7 of the [OEA python class](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/framework/synapse/notebook/OEA_py.ipynb). 

<ins><strong>Note:</ins></strong> 
All the steps outlined below are applicable to deployment of this module with production data. However, if you are doing a test deployment using the [test data sets](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/test_data) we provide as part of this module, skip to step 3.

1. Setup [School Data Sync](https://sds.microsoft.com/) to begin receiving usage data from M365. You can find videos about School Data Sync and Education Insights on the [Microsoft School Data Sync Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA8ZOC7eTfzLlkcFW3imkHg/featured) [for production data only].
2. Within School Data Sync, [enable the education data lake export](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/enable-education-data-lake-export) to land data in Stage 1 of your data lake [for production data only].
3. Run the [setup.sh script](https://github.com/Microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/setup.sh)
    * Open cloud shell in your Azure subscription (use ctrl+click on the button below to open in a new page)\
[![Launch Cloud Shell](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com/bash)
    * Download the module release to your Azure clouddrive \
`cd clouddrive`\
`wget https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/releases/download/module_Microsoft_Education_Insights_v0.1/module_Microsoft_Education_Insights_v0.1.zip`\
`unzip ./module_Microsoft_Education_Insights_v0.1.zip`
    * Run the setup script like this (substitute "mysynapseworkspacename" with your synapse workspace name, which must be less than 13 characters and can only contain letters and numbers - e.g. syn-oea-cisd3v07kw1): \
`./module_Microsoft_Education_Insights_v0.1/setup.sh mysynapseworkspacename`) to install this package into your own environment.
4. Run the [Insights module main pipeline template](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/pipeline) or the [Insights_example notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/notebook/Insights_example.ipynb) into your Synapse workspace to see the functionality of module assets.
     * It is recommended that you first run the module example notebook to understanding the methods of data processing, before running the pipeline. Although, running either the example notebook or the main pipeline accomplish the same processes.
5. Verify that the module pipeline landed data into stage 1 and 2, and SQL and lake databases were created. See the [module pipeline page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/pipeline) for detailed instructions.
6. Download the [module Power BI template file](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/powerbi). Module test data is already imported into the Power BI. See the [module Power BI page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/powerbi) page for details and instructions for switching the Power BI template data source, to import from your Synapse workspace data source.

#### OEA Digital Engagement Schema:

After completing the setup of this module, the MS Education Insights activity schema can be transformed into the [OEA schema standard for digital engagement](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/schemas/schema_catalog/Digital_Engagement_Schema). Refer to the documentation and assets to see how this module can be extended and standardized for OEA package-use.

## Data Sources

This module imports digital activity and roster data for an education system via [School Data Sync](https://sds.microsoft.com/).
- [Digital Activity Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/data-lake-schema-activity) provides a log of M365 signal activity from apps including Sharepoint, Teams Channel, Teams Meetings, Assignment Services, OneNote, Reading Progress, and Reflect.
- [Rostering Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/data-lake-schema-rostering) is concerned with students, teachers, courses, and schools relationships.
- [Azure Active Directory Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/data-lake-schema-azure-ad) provides people details and group memberships.

See the [module test data page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/test_data) for details on data format and contents.

## Module Components
Out-of-the box assets for this OEA module include: 
1. [Test Data](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/test_data): Two artificially generated test data sets, which supports the module pipeline and Power BI template. Test data matches the [School Data Sync](https://sds.microsoft.com/) format exactly. This asset also includes a metadata.csv which is responsible for schema definitions and the pseudonymization process.
    - [K-12 Test Data](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/test_data/k12_test_data): Test data formatted as a k-12 education system.
    - [Higher Education Test Data](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/test_data/hed_test_data): Test data formatted as a higher education system.
    - [metadata.csv](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/test_data/metadata.csv): Metadata CSV to support module data ingestion and refining for all Insights tables.
2. [Pipeline Template](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/pipeline): One main pipeline template which lands data into the data lake in Stage 1 (for raw data) and processes into the Stage 2 data lake (for structured, queryable data). Stage 2 data is then made available via a serverless SQL endpoint.
3. [Notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/notebook): Two sets of notebooks that can be used for either data exploration, or necessary for landing, schema cleaning, correction and refining data in the pipeline; notebooks are automatically installed upon running the setup script.
    - [Insights_example.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/notebook/Insights_example.ipynb): A module example notebook that demonstrates the basic functions of landing raw test data to Stage 1, ingestion from Stage 1 to Stage 2/Ingested, schema correction to stage2/Ingested_Corrected, and refinement to Stage2/Refined.
    - [Insights Pipeline-Supporting Notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/notebook): Module-specific notebooks that clean the data, ingests the Insights tables, corrects table schemas, and refines the dataset.
4. [PowerBI Template](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/powerbi): Four PowerBI templates which explores data in a basic way. Screenshots of the PowerBI example template(s) are shown below.
    - There are two separate dashboard data sets: one uses the K-12 module test data, and one uses the higher ed. test data. 
    - There are also two different formats of PowerBI files: one of which is pre-loaded with test data making it easy to quickly interact with data, and the other uses DirectQuery to query the data from your own Serverless SQL database. See instructions on the [module PowerBI page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/powerbi) to switch the dashboard data source to direct query from your Synapse workspace.
