# Test data

This module includes artificially generated data which matches the format of [Moodle SQL Database Table Exports](https://www.examulator.com/er/output/index.html).
- 27 tables formatted in CSVs, as described in the Moodle data dictionary. Assets can be adapted to integrate ingestion/refinement functionality for more, different or less tables.

<strong>Note:</strong> This module contains one set of test data - for mock higher education data. This module does not currently contain test data formatted as a K-12 institution.
